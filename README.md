# Priority-Based-Instruction-Scheduling-in-the-SimpleScalar-Simulator
This project enhances the SimpleScalar sim-outorder simulator by adding a priority-based instruction issue policy. Instructions are assigned priorities based on type and latency, allowing critical and long-latency operations to issue earlier. The modification improves pipeline efficiency and overall instruction throughput.
